## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface
- **Ant Design**: Component library for UI elements
- **Material UI**: Theming and styling
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **React Query**: For data fetching and caching
- **Chart.js/Recharts**: For data visualization
- **React-PDF**: For PDF generation

### Backend (Supabase)
- **Authentication**: User management and authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for data storage
- **Storage**: File storage for documents and payslips
- **Functions**: Serverless functions for complex operations
- **Realtime**: Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern architecture pattern with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend Layer**: React components organized by feature
2. **Service Layer**: API services for data fetching and manipulation
3. **Backend Layer**: Supabase services for data storage and processing

### Key Components

- **Authentication**: Secure login and role-based access control
- **Dashboard**: Overview of key metrics and alerts
- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employee data
- **Salary Structure**: Configuration of salary components and templates
- **Payroll Processing**: Calculation and approval of monthly salaries
- **Reporting**: Generation of various reports and analytics

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows an iterative approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Project setup, authentication, and basic dashboard
2. **Phase 2**: Employee management and salary structure configuration
3. **Phase 3**: Payroll processing and payslip generation
4. **Phase 4**: Attendance, leave, and tax integration
5. **Phase 5**: Reports, analytics, and final polishing

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based structure:

- **components/**: Reusable UI components
- **pages/**: Main application pages
- **services/**: API and data services
- **contexts/**: React contexts for global state
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks
- **utils/**: Utility functions
- **lib/**: Third-party library configurations

## Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for:

- Users and authentication
- Employees and their details
- Departments and roles
- Salary structures and components
- Payroll records and components
- Attendance and leave records
- Tax information and deductions
- Payslips and reports

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Set up the React application as outlined in setup-guide.md
2. Configure Supabase with the database schema
3. Implement the core features following the implementation plan
4. Test and deploy the application

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the following files:

- **database-schema.md**: Database structure and relationships
- **system-architecture.md**: System architecture and component design
- **project-structure.md**: Project directory structure and organization
- **implementation-plan.md**: Detailed implementation plan for each module
- **setup-guide.md**: Step-by-step setup instructions

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. Set up the project structure and dependencies
2. Implement authentication with Supabase Auth
3. Create the home page with admin login
4. Develop the admin dashboard layout and navigation

## Conclusion
